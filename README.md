This project involves the use of JavaCC / JJTree to construct a java compiler for our own programming language entitled: CAL - The project covers the first 4 phases of compiler construction: • Lexical Analysis • Syntax Analysis • Semantic Analysis • Intermediate Code Generation.

The compilation process consists of a number of phases. The
number of phases varies from compiler to compiler depending on
their complexity.

A basic set of phases are:
• Lexical Analysis
• Syntax Analysis
• Semantic Analysis
• Intermediate Code Generation
• Code Optimisation
• Code Generation

The first 3 phases comprise the front-end of the compiler.
The second 3 phases comprise the back-end of the compiler.
